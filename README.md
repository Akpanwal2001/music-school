# music-school
A responsive UI for a music school app built with Next.js, Acertenity UI, and TypeScript. This project focuses on clean, modern front-end design with component-based architecture. Data is managed using arrays of objects, with no backend or APIs implemented yet. Ideal as a foundation for future development and functionality expansion.
